## Description
I want to make a version of Tetris in Python. I found a barebones 

## Features
- Feature 1
	- A working Tetris based off of the video. Using pygame I can make a version of Tetris based off of a video I found online. 
- Feature 2
	- The ability to have a game over screen instead of it closing out. This can be done mostly with stuff we have already learnt in pygame. This was not in the video.
- Feature 3 
	- Background music. I can add music that was not in the video by using Pygame's .mixer function.

## Challenges
- How do I even make a working version of Tetris?
- How do I use pygame.mixer?
- How do I create a new instance that restarts the game loop from the beginning?
- Short sentence of any skill or topic that needs to be learnt or researched.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome of this is a game with all 3 aforementioned features. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Since I have a video I can work off of, the bare minimum for me would be a 100% working version of Tetris based off of the video and at least 1 feature, whether it be music or easier restarting. 

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Get most of, if not all, of the video's version of Tetris finished. 

- Week 2
  1. If the video's Tetris is not finished, finish that.
  2. Add music

- Week 3 (Final)
  1. Add easy restart functionality
