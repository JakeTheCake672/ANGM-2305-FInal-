## Description
This is a slightly barebones version of Tetris made with pygame and random. I found a video explaining how to make Tetris a few weeks before this project and decided to use it as a base for mine. Since codint is not my strongsuit, having a video to help was very nice since I didn't have to beat my head against a wall when I couldn't figure something out. 

I did not, however, just copy paste some code. I improved upon it in a few ways, mainly with fun and interesting extras. For starters I added a new H block that is not in the original Tetris. Why an H? My last name starts with H! Another cool thing I added was new music not in the original. While the video had music already, I took the liberty of adding some interesting sounds to say the least all of which are in the "Sounds" folder. I also added the instant fall mechanic in later Tetris titles and had it give more score than just speeding up the base fall. 

As for ways I feel it could be improved: there are hundreds. To name a few, there is a bug where if you spin the block right as it hits another one, it can crash. I have 0 idea how I could fix this but it works other than that. Better UI would also be nice, given that I just copied theirs. I'm VERY bad at design, so I focused on gameplay mechanics rather than making it look unique and different compared to the original. If I was a bit more creative and understoop Python more I could have probably done something really cool. 

Overall, I learnt a lot about pygame in this project. While I don't see myself doing this as a career, I do see myself coding for fun or to make things faster in the future. Even something as simple as Tetris has a lot of moving pieces to make it all work and I believe I learnt a ton from figuring out what everything does.
